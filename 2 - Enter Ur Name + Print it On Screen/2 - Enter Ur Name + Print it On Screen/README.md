# 📝 Problem 2: Read Name and Print It

## 📜 Description
This C++ program demonstrates how to read a user's name from the standard input and print it in a formatted message. It includes two main functions: `Read_Name` to obtain the user's input and `Print_Name` to display it ✍️.

## 💡 Code Explanation
- **📥 Headers**: The program includes `<iostream>` for input/output operations and `<string>` for string manipulation.
- **🔤 Function `Read_Name`**: Prompts the user to enter their name and returns it as a `string` 💬. It uses `getline` to read the entire line of input.
- **✍️ Function `Print_Name`**: Takes a `string` argument and prints it in a formatted message.
- **🖥️ Function `main`**: Calls `Read_Name` to get the user's name and then passes it to `Print_Name` to display it.


## ▶️ How to Run
It will prompt you to enter your name. After entering it, the program will display:

```
Your name is : [Your Name]
```
## 💬 Example
If you enter Alice when prompted, the output will be:
```
Your name is : Taha
```
## ✅ Requirements
- C++ compiler 💻
- Basic understanding of functions and string handling in C++ 📚
