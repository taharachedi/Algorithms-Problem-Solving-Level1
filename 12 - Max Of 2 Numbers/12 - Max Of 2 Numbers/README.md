# 📚 Problem 12: Finding the Maximum of Two Numbers

## 📜 Description
This C++ program reads two integers from the user and determines the maximum value between them. It provides a simple and effective way to find the larger of two numbers.

The program includes the following features:
- 🔹 `ReadNum`: Prompts the user to enter two numbers and captures them by reference.
- 🔹 `Maximun`: Compares the two numbers and returns the larger one.
- 🔹 `Print`: Displays the maximum number.

## 💡 Code Explanation

- **📥 Function `ReadNum`**:
  - This function takes two integer references as parameters and prompts the user to enter values for each. The entered values are stored in the corresponding reference variables.

- **➕ Function `Maximun`**:
  - Takes two integer parameters, compares them, and returns the larger value.

- **🖥️ Function `Print`**:
  - Accepts the maximum value as a parameter and prints it to the console.

- **📅 Function `main`**:
  - Declares two integer variables, calls `ReadNum` to populate them, and then calculates and displays the maximum using `Maximun` and `Print`.

## ▶️ Execution Example
When you enter the following numbers:
- First Number: `15`
- Second Number: `10`

The program will display:
```plaintext
The Max is : 15
